	implementation of transactional memory. Strong atomicity lets us
	offer clear semantics to programs, even if they access the same locations
	inside and outside transactions. It also avoids differences between
	hardware-implemented transactions and software-implemented ones.
	Our approach is to use off-the-shelf page-level memory protection
	hardware to detect conflicts between normal memory accesses and transactional
	ones. This page-level mechanism ensures correctness but gives poor
	performance because of the costs of manipulating memory protection
	settings and receiving notifications of access violations. However,
	in practice, we show how a combination of careful object placement
	and dynamic code update allows us to eliminate almost all of the
	protection changes. Existing implementations of strong atomicity
	in software rely on detecting conflicts by conservatively treating
	some non-transactional accesses as short transactions. In contrast,
	our page-level mechanism lets us be less conservative about how non-transactional
	accesses are treated; we avoid changes to non-transactional code
	until a possible conflict is detected dynamically, and we can respond
	to phase changes where a given instruction sometimes generates conflicts
	and sometimes does not. We evaluate our implementation with C# versions
	of many of the STAMP benchmarks, and show how it performs within
	25% of an implementation with weak atomicity on all the benchmarks
	we have studied. It avoids pathological cases in which other implementations
	of strong atomicity perform poorly.},

  booktitle = {SSYM'00: Proc. 9th Conf. USENIX Security Symp.},
  year = {2000},
  pages = {1--17},
  abstract = {Designing a suitable confinement mechanism to confine untrusted applications
	is challenging as such a mechanism needs to satisfy conflicting requirements.
	The main trade-off is between ease of use and flexibility. In this
	paper, we present the design, implementation and evaluation of MAPbox,
	a confinement mechanism that retains the ease of use of application-class-specific
	sandboxes such as the Java applet sandbox and the Janus document
	viewer sandbox while providing significantly more flexibility. The
	key idea is to group application behaviors into classes based on
	their expected functionality and the resources required to achieve
	that functionality. Classification of application behavior provides
	a set of labels (e.g., compiler, reader, netclient) that can be used
	to concisely communicate the expected functionality of programs between
	the provider and the users. This is similar to MIME-types which are
	widely used to concisely describe the expected format of data files.
	An end-user lists the set of application behaviors she is willing
	to allow in a file. With each label, she associates a sandbox that
	limits access to the set of resources needed to achieve the corresponding
	behavior. When an untrusted application is to be run, this file is
	consulted. If the label (or the MAP-type) associated with the application
	is not found in this file, it is not allowed to run. Else, the MAP-type
	is used to automatically locate and instantiate the appropriate sandbox.
	We believe that this may be an acceptable level of user interaction
	since a similar technique (i.e., MIME-types) has been fairly successful
	for handling documents with different formats. In this paper, we
	present a set of application behavior classes that we have identified
	based on a study of a diverse suite of applications that includes
	CGI scripts, programs downloaded from well-known web repositories
	and applications from the Solaris 5.6 distribution. We describe the
	implementation and usage of MAPbox. We evaluate MAPbox from two different
	perspectives: its effectiveness (how well it is able to confine a
	suite of untrusted applications) and effciency (what is the overhead
	introduced). Finally, we describe our experience with MAPbox and
	discuss potential limitations of this approach.},

	is extremely difficult as effective testing approaches for such bugs

	which can monitor such applications for security violations and take

	an approach for monitoring the security health of a software system.
	Our methodology involves an agent based approach which communicates
	with the health monitoring system running as an independent process.
	We make this agent a part of the application (binary) and modify
	the binary at appropriate locations to transfer the control to the
	agent attached. The agent sends critical information regarding the
	execution to the monitoring system. The monitoring system analyzes
	the data and takes suitable actions. Currently our system monitors
	the following security bugs uffer overflow, race conditions (time
	of check to time to use vulnerability), random number vulnerability

  booktitle = {SPAA '08},
  year = {2008},
  pages = {110--112},
  publisher = {ACM},
  abstract = {Researchers in transactional memory (TM) have proposed open-nested
	transactions for increasing concurrency. The idea is to ignore "low-level"
	memory operations of the open-nested transaction when detecting conflicts
	for its parent transaction, and instead perform abstract concurrency
	control for the "high-level" operation that nested transaction represents.
	Unfortunately, because the TM runtime is unaware of the different
	levels of memory, an unconstrained use of open-nested commits can
	lead to anomalous program behavior.


	We propose ownership-aware transactional memory (OATM) which explicitly
	incorporates the notion of modules into the TM system, and requires
	that transactions and data be associated with specific transactional
	modules or Xmodules. When a transaction in the OATM commits, the
	TM system uses this information about Xmodules and commits a piece
	of data differently depending on whether the current Xmodule owns
	the data or not. We call this commit mechanism ownership-aware commit,
	and it is a hybrid between an open-nested and closed-nested commit.
	Moreover, we give a set of precise constraints on interactions and
	sharing of data among the Xmodules based on familiar notions of abstractions.
	We prove that OATM has has clean memory-level semantics and can guarantee
	serializability by modules, which is an adaptation of multilevel
	serializability from databases to TM. Finally, we prove that if transactions
	in the process of aborting obey restrictions on their memory footprint,
	the OATM is free from semantic deadlock.},

	collectors, as well as a hybrid of the two. We describe the optimizations
	necessary to achieve good performance across all of the collectors,

	sharing of free lists. We then quantitatively compare the different
	collectors to find their asymptotic performance both with respect
	to how fast they can run applications as well as how little memory
	they can run them in. All of our collectors scale linearly up to
	sixteen processors. The least memory is usually required by the hybrid
	mark-sweep collector that uses a copying collector for its nursery,
	although sometimes the non-generational mark-sweep collector requires
	less memory. The fastest execution is more application-dependent.
	Our only application with a large working set performed best using
	the mark-sweep collector; with one exception, the rest of the applications
	ran fastest with one of the generational collectors.},

  abstract = {Injecting binary code into a running program is a common form of attack.
	Most defenses employ a “guard the doors ” approach, blocking known
	mechanisms of code injection. Randomized instruction set emulation
	(RISE) is a complementary method of defense, one that performs a
	hidden randomization of an application’s machine code. If foreign
	binary code is injected into a program running under RISE, it will
	not be executable because it will not know the proper randomization.
	The paper describes and analyzes RISE, describing a proof-of-concept
	implementation built on the open-source Valgrind IA32-to-IA32 translator.
	The prototype effectively disrupts binary code injection attacks,
	without requiring recompilation, linking, or access to application
	source code. Under RISE, injected code (attacks) essentially executes
	random code sequences. Empirical studies and a theoretical model
	are reported which treat the effects of executing random code on
	two different architectures (IA32 and PowerPC). The paper discusses
	possible extensions and applications of the RISE technique in other

	operations - that is, those which cannot be transparently undone
	by a TM system - should be handled. This uncertainty poses a significant
	barrier to the general applicability and acceptance of TM. Further,
	the absence of transactional workloads makes it difficult to study
	this aspect In this paper, we characterize the usage of I/O, and
	in particular system calls, within critical sections in two large
	applications, exploring both the actions performed and the characteristics
	of the critical sections in which they are performed. Shared memory
	programs employing critical sections are the closest approximation
	available to transactional workloads, so using this characterization,
	we attempt to reason about how the behavior we observed relates to
	the previous proposals for handling side-effecting operations within
	transactions. We find that the large majority of syscalls performed
	within critical sections can be handled with a range of existing
	techniques in a way transparent to the application developer. We
	also find that while side-effecting critical sections are rare, they
	tend to be quite long-lasting, and that many of these critical sections
	perform their first syscall (and thus become side-effecting) relatively
	early in their execution. Finally, we show that while these long-lived,
	side-effecting critical sections tend to execute concurrently with
	many critical sections on other threads, we observe little concurrency
	between side-effecting critical sections.},

  abstract = {Attacks which exploit memory programming errors (such as buffer overflows)
	are one of today’s most seri ous security threats. These attacks
	require an attacker to have an in-depth understanding of the internal
	details of a victim program, including the locations of critical
	data and/or code. Program obfuscation is a general technique for
	securing programs by making it difficult for attackers to acquire
	such a detailed understanding. This paper de- velops a systematic
	study of a particular kind of obfusca- tion called address obfuscation
	that randomizes the loca- tion of victim program data and code. We
	discuss differ- ent implementation strategies to randomize the absolute
	locations of data and code, as well as relative distances between
	data locations. We then present our implemen- tation that transforms
	object files and executables at link- time and load-time. It requires
	no changes to the OS ker- nel or compilers, and can be applied to
	individual appli- cations without affecting the rest of the system.
	It can be implemented with low runtime overheads. Address ob- fuscation
	can reduce the probability of successful attacks to be as low as
	a small fraction of a percent for most memory-error related attacks.
	Moreover, the random- ization ensures that an attack that succeeds
	against one victim will likely not succeed against another victim,
	or even for a second time against the same victim. Each failed attempt
	will typically crash the victim program, thereby making it easy to
	detect attack attempts. These aspects make it particularly effective
	against large-scale attacks such as Code Red, since each infection
	attempt requires significantly more resources, thereby slowing down
	the propagation rate of such attacks.},

	semantics for transactional memory systems is based on "single global
	lock atomicity", i.e. on the semantics of a single global lock. We
	argue that this should be taken one step further: The synchronization
	operations seen by the programmer should really just be locks, possibly
	with some syntactic sugar for easier programming with a single global
	lock.


	Use as a deadlock-free lock replacement does not require any rollback
	primitive, or any other constructs that expose properties of the
	implementation. And it appears that such extensions add considerable
	complexity. Instead, the implementation should strive to optimize
	coarse-grain locks, for example by implementing them using transactional

	with a prototype called Disco that runs multiple copies of Silicon
	Graphics' IRIX operating system on a multiprocessor. Our experience
	shows that the overheads of the monitor are small and that the approach
	provides scalability as well as the ability to deal with the nonuniform
	memory access time of these systems. To reduce the memory overheads
	associated with running multiple operating systems, virtual machines
	transparently share major data structures such as the program code

	creates filesystem links, thereby “tricking” a victim program into

	providing assurance that files in “safe directories ” (such as /etc/passwd)
	cannot be opened by looking up a file by an “unsafe pathname ” (such
	as a pathname that resolves through a symbolic link in a world-writable
	directory). In today’s UNIX systems, solutions to this problem are
	typically built into (some) applications and use applicationspecific
	knowledge about (un)safety of certain directories. In contrast, we
	seek solutions that can be implemented in the filesystem itself (or
	a library on top of it), thus providing protection to all applications.
	Our solution is built around the concept of pathname manipulators,
	which are roughly the users that can influence the result of a file
	lookup operation. For each user, we distinguish unsafe pathnames
	from safe pathnames according to whether or not the pathname has
	any manipulators other than that user or root. We propose a safe-open
	procedure that keeps track of the safety of the current pathname

	files with unsafe pathnames. We prove that our solution can prevent
	a common class of filename-based privilege escalation attacks, and
	describe our implementation of the safe-open procedure as a library
	function over the POSIX filesystem interface. We tested our implementation
	on several UNIX variants to evaluate its implications for systems
	and applications. Our experiments suggest that this solution can
	be deployed in a portable way without breaking existing systems,

  abstract = {Commodity operating systems entrusted with securing sensitive data
	are remarkably large and complex, and consequently, frequently prone
	to compromise. To address this limitation, we introduce a virtual-machine-based
	system called Overshadow that protects the privacy and integrity
	of application data, even in the event of a total OScompromise. Overshadow
	presents an application with a normal view of its resources, but
	the OS with an encrypted view. This allows the operating system to
	carry out the complex task of managing an application's resources,
	without allowing it to read or modify them. Thus, Overshadow offers
	a last line of defense for application data.


	Overshadow builds on multi-shadowing, a novel mechanism that presents
	different views of "physical" memory, depending on the context performing
	the access. This primitive offers an additional dimension of protection
	beyond the hierarchical protection domains implemented by traditional
	operating systems and processor architectures.


	We present the design and implementation of Overshadow and show how
	its new protection semantics can be integrated with existing systems.

	forfeit Java's portability or introduce unconventional programming
	constructs, Java-Split is able to execute standard multithreaded
	Java while preserving portability. JavaSplit works by rewriting the
	bytecodes of a given parallel application, transforming it into a

	Each runtime node carries out its part of the resulting distributed
	computation using nothing but its local standard (unmodified) Java

  abstract = {Code sandboxing is useful for many purposes, but most sandboxing techniques
	require kernel modifications, do not completely isolate guest code,
	or incur substantial performance costs. Vx32 is a multipurpose user-level
	sandbox that enables any application to load and safely execute one
	or more guest plug-ins, confining each guest to a system call API
	controlled by the host application and to a restricted memory region
	within the host's address space. Vx32 runs guest code efficiently
	on several widespread operating systems without kernel extensions
	or special privileges; it protects the host program from both reads
	and writes by its guests; and it allows the host to restrict the
	instruction set available to guests. The key to vx32's combination
	of portability, flexibility, and efficiency is its use of x86 segmentation
	hardware to sandbox the guest's data accesses, along with a lightweight
	instruction translator to sandbox guest instructions.


	We evaluate vx32 using microbenchmarks and whole system benchmarks,
	and we examine four applications based on vx32: an archival storage
	system, an extensible public-key infrastructure, an experimental
	user-level operating system running atop another host OS, and a Linux
	system call jail. The first three applications export custom APIs
	independent of the host OS to their guests, making their plug-ins
	binary-portable across host systems. Compute-intensive workloads
	for the first two applications exhibit between a 30\% slowdown and
	a 30\% speedup on vx32 relative to native execution; speedups result
	from vx32's instruction translator improving the cache locality of
	guest code. The experimental user-level operating system allows the
	use of the guest OS's applications alongside the host's native applications
	and runs faster than whole-system virtual machine monitors such as
	VMware and QEMU. The Linux system call jail incurs up to 80\% overhead
	but requires no kernel modifications and is delegation-based, avoiding

	This raises significant security concerns. Therefore, it is desirable

	We propose to reduce the risk of a security breach by restricting
	the program's access to the operating system. In particular, we intercept

	However, these implementations perform poorly because they interpose

	the block and later reconciled with the heap when leaving the block.This

	we introduce a new 'direct access' implementation that avoids searching
	thread-private logs, (2) we develop compiler optimizations to reduce
	the amount of logging (e.g. when a thread accesses the same data
	repeatedly in an atomic block), (3) we use runtime filtering to detect

	interface of our previous DSTM library. Furthermore, researchers
	can experiment with alternative STM mechanisms by providing their

	factories: one that uses essentially the same mechanisms as the original
	DSTM (with some enhancements),and another that uses a completely
	different approach.Because DSTM2 is packaged as a Java library, a
	wide range of programmers can easily try it out, and the community
	can begin to gain experience with transactional programming. Furthermore,
	researchers will be able to use the body of transactional programs
	that arises from this community experience to test and evaluate different
	STM mechanisms simply by supplying new transactional factories. We

	instrumentation, dynamic optimization, security policy enforcement,

	the overhead (runtime, memory usage, and power consumption) should
	be as low as possible. For instance, if an SDT system is protecting
	a web server against possible attacks, but causes 30% slowdown, a
	company may need 30% more machines to handle the web traffic they
	expect. Consequently, the causes of SDT overhead should be studied
	rigorously. This work evaluates many alternative policies for the
	creation of fragments within the Strata SDT framework. In particular,
	we examine the effects of ending translation at conditional branches;
	ending translation at unconditional branches; whether to use partial
	inlining for call instructions; whether to build the target of calls
	immediately or lazily; whether to align branch targets; and how to
	place code to transition back to the dynamic translator. We find
	that effective translation strategies are vital to program performance,
	improving performance from as much as 28% overhead, to as little
	as 3% overhead on average for the SPEC CPU2000 benchmark suite. We
	further demonstrate that these translation strategies are effective

	Athlon Opteron, and Intel Pentium IV processors.},

	Instead of proving a system satisfies noninterference assertions,
	we derive an algorithm for checking the assertions at run-time based

	Our methodology can detect unknown race-condition attacks. In addition,
	this work provides an example of the application of formal specification

	form of data-parallelism called amorphous data-parallelism. However,

	how much amorphous data-parallelism actually exists in irregular

	In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of a tool

	of amorphous data-parallelism at different points in the execution
	of an algorithm, independent of implementation-dependent details
	such as the number of cores, cache sizes, load-balancing, etc. ParaMeter
	can also generate constrained parallelism profiles for a fixed number

	framework designed to support transparent, lifelong program analysis
	and transformation for arbitrary programs, by providing high-level
	information to compiler transformations at compile-time, link-time,
	run-time, and in idle time between runs. LLVM defines a common, low-level
	code representation in Static Single Assignment (SSA) form, with
	several novel features: a simple, language-independent type-system
	that exposes the primitives commonly used to implement high-level
	language features; an instruction for typed address arithmetic; and
	a simple mechanism that can be used to implement the exception handling
	features of high-level languages (and setjmp/longjmp in C) uniformly
	and efficiently. The LLVM compiler framework and code representation
	together provide a combination of key capabilities that are important
	for practical, lifelong analysis and transformation of programs.
	To our knowledge, no existing compilation approach provides all these
	capabilities. We describe the design of the LLVM representation and
	compiler framework, and evaluate the design in three ways: (a) the
	size and effectiveness of the representation, including the type
	information it provides; (b) compiler performance for several interprocedural

	reproduces the behavior of applications, as if they were running
	natively on the underlying (host) operating system. This is accomplished
	via one-way isolation: processes running within the SEE are given
	read-access to the environment provided by the host OS, but their
	write operations are prevented from escaping outside the SEE. As
	a result, SEE processes cannot impact the behavior of host OS processes,
	or the integrity of data on the host OS. SEEs support a wide range
	of tasks, including: study of malicious code, controlled execution
	of untrusted software, experimentation with software configuration
	changes, testing of software patches, and so on. It provides a convenient
	way for users to inspect system changes made within the SEE. If these
	changes are not accepted, they can be rolled back at the click of
	a button. Otherwise, the changes can be committed so as to become
	visible outside the SEE. We provide consistency criteria that ensure
	semantic consistency of the committed results. We develop two different
	implementation approaches, one in user-land and the other in the

	program analysis tasks such as profiling, performance evaluation,
	and bug detection. To meet this need, we have developed a new instrumentation
	system called Pin. Our goals are to provide easy-to-use, portable,
	transparent, and efficient instrumentation. Instrumentation tools
	(called Pintools) are written in C/C++ using Pin's rich API. Pin
	follows the model of ATOM, allowing the tool writer to analyze an
	application at the instruction level without the need for detailed
	knowledge of the underlying instruction set. The API is designed
	to be architecture independent whenever possible, making Pintools
	source compatible across different architectures. However, a Pintool
	can access architecture-specific details when necessary. Instrumentation
	with Pin is mostly transparent as the application and Pintool observe
	the application's original, uninstrumented behavior. Pin uses dynamic
	compilation to instrument executables while they are running. For
	efficiency, Pin uses several techniques, including inlining, register
	re-allocation, liveness analysis, and instruction scheduling to optimize
	instrumentation. This fully automated approach delivers significantly
	better instrumentation performance than similar tools. For example,
	Pin is 3.3x faster than Valgrind and 2x faster than DynamoRIO for
	basic-block counting. To illustrate Pin's versatility, we describe
	two Pintools in daily use to analyze production software. Pin is
	publicly available for Linux platforms on four architectures: IA32
	(32-bit x86), EM64T (64-bit x86), Itanium®, and ARM. In the ten months

	while providing scalability competitive to fine-grained locking.
	Language-based constructs allow programmers to denote atomic regions
	declaratively and to rely on the underlying system to provide transactional
	guarantees along with concurrency. In contrast with fine-grained
	locking, TM allows programmers to write simpler programs that are
	composable and deadlock-free.


	TM implementations operate by tracking loads and stores to memory
	and by detecting concurrent conflicting accesses by different transactions.
	By automating this process, they greatly reduce the programmer's
	burden, but they also are forced to be conservative. Incertain cases,
	conflicting memory accesses may not actually violate the higher-level
	semantics of a program, and a programmer may wish to allow seemingly
	conflicting transactions to execute concurrently.


	Open nested transactions enable expert programmers to differentiate
	between physical conflicts, at the level of memory, and logical conflicts
	that actually violate application semantics. A TMsystem with open
	nesting can permit physical conflicts that are not logical conflicts,
	and thus increase concurrency among application threads.


	Here we present an implementation of open nested transactions in a
	Java-based software transactional memory (STM)system. We describe
	new language constructs to support open nesting in Java, and we discuss
	new abstract locking mechanisms that a programmer can use to prevent
	logical conflicts. We demonstrate how these constructs can be mapped
	efficiently to existing STM data structures. Finally, we evaluate
	our system on a set of Java applications and data structures, demonstrating

	(TM) has emerged as a promising programming model allowing programmers
	to focus on parallelism rather than maintaining correctness and avoiding
	deadlock. Many implementations of hardware, software, and hybrid

	(STMs) are especially compelling since they can be used with current

	to implementing STM that supports C and C++ code. Furthermore, by
	using value-based conflict detection, JudoSTM additionally supports
	the transactional execution of both (i) irreversible system calls

  abstract = {Transactional memory promises to generalize transactional programming
	to mainstream languages and data structures. The purported benefit
	of transactions is that they are easier to program correctly than
	fine-grained locking and perform just as well. This performance claim
	is not always borne out because an application may violate a common-case
	assumption of the TM designer or because of external system effects.
	This paper carefully studies a range of factors that can adversely
	influence transactional memory performance.

	In order to help programmers assess the suitability of their code
	for transactional memory, this paper introduces a formal model of
	transactional memory as well as a tool, called Syncchar. Syncchar
	can predict the speedup of a conversion from locks to transactions
	within 25% for the STAMP benchmarks. We also use

	the Syncchar tool to diagnose and eliminate a starvation pathology
	in the TxLinux kernel, improving the performance of the Modified
	Andrew Benchmark by 55% over Linux.

	The paper also presents the first detailed study of how the performance
	of user-level transactional programs (from the STAMP benchmarks)
	are influenced by factors outside of the transactional memory system.
	The study includes data about the interaction of transactional programs
	with the architecture, memory allocator, and compiler. Because many

	good performance from transactions is more difficult than commonly

	they can equip their malware programs with checks that detect whether

	because they simply integrate with a wide range of native code libraries
	and embedding applications. However, further development of these
	runtimes in the areas of concurrency, efficiency and safety is impeded
	by the desire to maintain their native code interfaces, even at a
	source level. Native extension modules' lack of thread safety is
	a significant barrier to dynamic languages' effective deployment
	on current and future multicore and multiprocessor systems. We propose
	the use of hardware transactional memory (HTM) to aid runtimes in
	evolving more capable and robust execution models while maintaining
	native code compatibility. To explore these ideas, we constructed
	a full-system simulation infrastructure consisting of an HTM implementation,
	modified Linux kernel and Python interpreter.Python includes thread
	constructs, but its primary implementation is not architected to
	support their parallel execution. With small changes, a runtime can
	be made HTM-aware to enable parallel execution of Python code and
	extension modules. We exploit the semantics of Python execution to
	evaluate individual bytecodes atomically by default, using nested
	transactions to emulate programmer-specified locking constructs where
	possible in existing threaded code. We eliminate common transactional
	conflicts and defer I/O within transactions to make parallel Python
	execution both possible and efficient. Transactions also provide
	safety for foreign function invocations. We characterize several
	small Python applications executing on our infrastructure.},

	often leads to deadlocks, makes fine-grained synchronization difficult,
	hinders composition of atomic primitives, and provides no support
	for error recovery. Transactions avoid many of these problems, and
	therefore, promise to ease concurrent programming.We describe a software
	transactional memory (STM) system that is part of McRT, an experimental
	Multi-Core RunTime. The McRT-STM implementation uses a number of
	novel algorithms, and supports advanced features such as nested transactions
	with partial aborts, conditional signaling within a transaction,
	and object based conflict detection for C/C++ applications. The McRT-STM

	that works on arbitrary values, coexists with the STM, and can be
	used as a more efficient form of transactional memory. To provide
	a baseline we compare the performance of the STM with that of fine-grained

@ARTICLE{strataSVE,

  title = {Safe Virtual Execution Using Software Dynamic Translation},
  journal = {ACSAC'02},
  abstract = {Safe virtual execution (SVE) allows a host computer system to reduce
	the risks associated with running untrusted programs. SVE prevents
	untrusted programs from directly accessing system resources, thereby
	giving the host the ability to control how individual resources may
	be used. SVE is used in a variety of safety-conscious software systems,
	including the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), software fault isolation
	(SFI), system call interposition layers, and execution monitors.
	While SVE is the conceptual foundation for these systems, each uses
	a different implementation technology. The lack of a unifying framework
	for building SVE systems results in a variety of problems: many useful
	SVE systems are not portable and therefore are usable only on a limited
	number of platforms; code reuse among different SVE systems is often
	difficult or impossible; and building SVE systems from scratch can
	be both time consuming and error prone.

	To address these concerns, we have developed a portable, extensible
	framework for constructing SVE systems. Our framework, called Strata,
	is based on software dynamic translation (SDT), a technique for modifying
	binary programs as they execute. Strata is designed to be ported
	easily to new platforms and to date has been targeted to SPARC/Solaris,
	x86/Linux, and MIPS/IRIX. This portability ensures that SVE applications
	implemented in Strata are available to a wide variety of host systems.
	Strata also affords the opportunity for code reuse among different
	SVE applications by establishing a common implementation framework.

	Strata implements a basic safe virtual execution engine using SDT.
	The base functionality supplied by this engine is easily extended
	to implement specific SVE systems. In this paper we describe the
	organization of Strata and demonstrate its extension by building
	two SVE systems: system call interposition and stack-smashing prevention.
	To illustrate the use of the system call interposition extensions,
	the paper presents implementations of several useful security policies.},

  abstract = {Address-space randomization is a technique used to fortify systems
	against buffer overflow attacks. The idea is to introduce artificial
	diversity by randomizing the memory location of certain system components.
	This mechanism is available for both Linux (via PaX ASLR) and OpenBSD.
	We study the effectiveness of address-space randomization and find
	that its utility on 32-bit architectures is limited by the number
	of bits available for address randomization. In particular, we demonstrate
	a <i>derandomization attack</i> that will convert any standard buffer-overflow
	exploit into an exploit that works against systems protected by address-space
	randomization. The resulting exploit is as effective as the original
	exploit, although it takes a little longer to compromise a target
	machine: on average 216 seconds to compromise Apache running on a
	Linux PaX ASLR system. The attack does not require running code on
	the stack.


	We also explore various ways of strengthening address-space randomization
	and point out weaknesses in each. Surprisingly, increasing the frequency
	of re-randomizations adds at most 1 bit of security. Furthermore,
	compile-time randomization appears to be more effective than runtime
	randomization. We conclude that, on 32-bit architectures, the only
	benefit of PaX-like address-space randomization is a small slowdown
	in worm propagation speed. The cost of randomization is extra complexity

  abstract = {For the past 30+ years, system calls have been the de facto interface
	used by applications to request services from the operating system
	kernel. System calls have almost universally been implemented as
	a synchronous mechanism, where a special processor instruction is
	used to yield userspace execution to the kernel. In the first part
	of this paper, we evaluate the performance impact of traditional
	synchronous system calls on system intensive workloads. We show that
	synchronous system calls negatively affect performance in a significant
	way, primarily because of pipeline flushing and pollution of key
	processor structures (e.g., TLB, data and instruction caches, etc.).


	We propose a new mechanism for applications to request services from
	the operating system kernel: exception-less system calls. They improve

  abstract = {In Software Transactional Memory (STM), contention management refers
	to the mechanisms used to ensure forward progress--to avoid livelock
	and starvation, and to promote throughput and fairness. Unfortunately,
	most past approaches to contention management were designed for obstruction-free
	STM frameworks, and impose significant constant-time overheads. Priority-based
	approaches in particular typically require that reads be visible
	to all transactions, an expensive property that is not easy to support
	in most STM systems.


	In this paper we present a comprehensive strategy for contention management
	via fair resolution of conflicts in an STM with invisible reads.
	Our strategy depends on (1) lazy acquisition of ownership, (2) extendable
	timestamps, and (3) an efficient way to capture both priority and
	conflicts. We introduce two mechanisms--one using Bloom filters,
	the other using visible read bits--that implement point (3). These
	mechanisms unify the notions of conflict resolution, inevitability,
	and transaction retry. They are orthogonal to the rest of the contention
	management strategy, and could be used in a wide variety of hardware
	and software TM systems. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that
	the overhead of the mechanisms is low, particularly when conflicts
	are rare, and that our strategy as a whole provides good throughput
	and fairness, including livelock and starvation freedom, even for
	challenging workloads.},

	rewriting during translation in an attempt to reduce execution time.
	When dynamic translation is used as a ubiquitous policy enforcement
	mechanism, the majority of program executions have no dominating
	inner loop that can be used to amortize the cost of translation.
	Even under more favorable usage assumptions, our measurements show
	that such optimizations offer no significant benefit in most cases.
	A simpler, more maintainable, adaptable, and smaller translator may
	be preferable to more complicated designs.


	In this paper, we present HDTrans, a light-weight IA-32 to IA-32 binary
	translation system that uses some simple and effective translation
	techniques in combination with established trace linearization and
	code caching optimizations. We also present an evaluation of translation
	overhead under non-ideal conditions, showing that conventional benchmarks
	do not provide a good prediction of translation overhead when used
	pervasively.


	A further contribution of this paper is an analysis of the effectiveness
	of post-compile static pre-translation techniques for overhead reduction.
	Our results indicate that static pre-translation is effective only
	when expensive instrumentation or optimization is performed, and
	that efficient reload of pre-translated code incurs a substantial
	execution-time penalty.},

	paper describes novel compiler and runtime mechanisms that address

	programming on a set of concurrent data structures and the SPLASH-2
	benchmark suite. On a 16 processor SMP system, the transaction-based
	version of the SPLASH-2 benchmarks scales much better than the coarse-grain
	locking version and performs comparably to the fine-grain locking
	version. Compiler optimizations significantly reduce the overheads
	of transactional memory so that, on a single thread, the transaction-based
	version incurs only about 6.4% overhead compared to the lock-based
	version for the SPLASH-2 benchmark suite. Thus, our system is the
	first to demonstrate that transactions integrate well with an unmanaged

  abstract = {An organization's data is often its most valuable asset, but today's
	file systems provide few facilities to ensure its safety. Databases,
	on the other hand, have long provided transactions. Transactions
	are useful because they provide atomicity, consistency, isolation,
	and durability (ACID). Many applications could make use of these
	semantics, but databases have a wide variety of nonstandard interfaces.
	For example, applications like mail servers currently perform elaborate
	error handling to ensure atomicity and consistency, because it is
	easier than using a DBMS. A transaction-oriented programming model
	eliminates complex error-handling code because failed operations
	can simply be aborted without side effects. We have designed a file
	system that exports ACID transactions to user-level applications,
	while preserving the ubiquitous and convenient POSIX interface. In
	our prototype ACID file system, called Amino, updated applications
	can protect arbitrary sequences of system calls within a transaction.
	Unmodified applications operate without any changes, but each system
	call is transaction protected. We also built a recoverable memory
	library with support for nested transactions to allow applications
	to keep their in-memory data structures consistent with the file
	system. Our performance evaluation shows that ACID semantics can
	be added to applications with acceptable overheads. When Amino adds
	atomicity, consistency, and isolation functionality to an application,

	and tuning programs which use transactions.


	In this paper we introduce a series of profiling techniques for TM
	applications that provide in-depth and comprehensive information
	about the wasted work caused by aborting transactions. We explore
	three directions: (i) techniques to identify multiple potential conflicts
	from a single program run, (ii) techniques to identify the data structures
	involved in conflicts by using a symbolic path through the heap,
	rather than a machine address, and (iii) visualization techniques
	to summarize how threads spend their time and which of their transactions
	conflict most frequently.


	To examine the effectiveness of the profiling techniques, we provide
	a series of illustrations from the STAMP TM benchmark suite and from
	the synthetic WormBench workload. We show how to use our profiling
	techniques to optimize the performance of the Bayes, Labyrinth and
	Intruder applications.


	We discuss the design and implementation of our techniques in the
	Bartok-STM system. We process data offline or during garbage collection,
	where possible, in order to minimize the probe effect introduced
	by profiling.},

   abstract = {
   Prior work has shown that return oriented programming (ROP) can be used to bypass W^X, a software defense that stops shellcode, by reusing instructions from large libraries such as libc. Modern operating systems have since enabled address randomization (ASLR), which randomizes the location of libc, making these techniques unusable in practice. However, modern ASLR implementations leave smaller amounts of executable code unrandomized and it has been unclear whether an attacker can use these small code fragments to construct payloads in the general case.

In this paper, we show defenses as currently deployed can be bypassed with new techniques for automatically creating ROP payloads from small amounts of unrandomized code. We propose using semantic program verification techniques for identifying the functionality of gadgets, and design a ROP compiler that is resistant to missing gadget types. To demonstrate our techniques, we build Q, an end-to-end system that automatically generates ROP payloads for a given binary. Q can produce payloads for 80\% of Linux /usr/bin programs larger than 20KB. We also show that Q can automatically perform exploit hardening: given an exploit that crashes with defenses on, Q outputs an exploit that bypasses both W^X and ASLR. We show that Q can harden nine real-world Linux and Windows exploits, enabling an attacker to automatically bypass defenses as deployed by industry for those programs.

These attacks remain a serious problem despite previous research on techniques to prevent them. We present Write Integrity Testing (WIT), a new technique that provides practical protection from these attacks. WIT uses points-to analysis at compile time to compute the control-flow graph and the set of objects that can be written by each instruction in the program. Then it generates code instrumented to prevent instructions from modifying objects that are not in the set computed by the static analysis, and to ensure that indirect control transfers are allowed by the control-flow graph. To improve coverage where the analysis is not precise enough, WIT inserts small guards between the original program objects. We describe an efficient implementation with optimizations to reduce space and time overhead. This implementation can be used in practice because it compiles C and C++ programs without modifications, it has high coverage with no false positives, and it has low overhead. WIT's average runtime overhead is only 7\% across a set of CPU intensive benchmarks and it is negligible when IO is the bottleneck.}

We believe that previous fault isolation techniques are not widely used because they cannot isolate existing kernel extensions with low overhead on standard hardware. This is a hard problem because these extensions communicate with the kernel using a complex interface and they communicate frequently. We present BGI (Byte-Granularity Isolation), a new software fault isolation technique that addresses this problem. BGI uses efficient byte-granularity memory protection to isolate kernel extensions in separate protection domains that share the same address space. BGI ensures type safety for kernel objects and it can detect common types of errors inside domains. Our results show that BGI is practical: it can isolate Windows drivers without requiring changes to the source code and it introduces a CPU overhead between 0 and 16\%. BGI can also find bugs during driver testing. We found 28 new bugs in widely used Windows drivers. }

In particular, exploitable vulnerabilities in kernel modules are common. This paper proposes LXFI, a system which isolates kernel modules from the core kernel so that vulnerabilities in kernel modules cannot lead to a privilege escalation attack. To safely give kernel modules access to complex kernel APIs, LXFI introduces the notion of API integrity, which captures the set of contracts assumed by an interface. To partition the privileges within a shared module, LXFI introduces module principals. Programmers specify principals and API integrity rules through capabilities and annotations. Using a compiler plugin, LXFI instruments the generated code to grant, check, and transfer capabilities between modules, according to the programmer's annotations. An evaluation with Linux shows that the annotations required on kernel functions to support a new module are moderate, and that LXFI is able to prevent three known privilege-escalation vulnerabilities. Stress tests of a network driver module also show that isolating this module using LXFI does not hurt TCP throughput but reduces UDP throughput by 35\%, and increases CPU utilization by 2.2-3.7x.

 abstract = { Memory corruption, reading uninitialized memory, using freed memory, and other memory-related errors are among the most difficult programming bugs to identify and fix due to the delay and non-determinism linking the error to an observable symptom. Dedicated memory checking tools are invaluable for finding these errors. However, such tools are difficult to build, and because they must monitor all memory accesses by the application, they incur significant overhead. Accuracy is another challenge: memory errors are not always straightforward to identify, and numerous false positive error reports can make a tool unusable. A third obstacle to creating such a tool is that it depends on low-level operating system and architectural details, making it difficult to port to other platforms and difficult to target proprietary systems like Windows. This paper presents Dr. Memory, a memory checking tool that operates on both Windows and Linux applications. Dr. Memory handles the complex and not fully documented Windows environment, and avoids reporting false positive memory leaks that plague traditional leak locating algorithms. Dr. Memory employs efficient instrumentation techniques; a direct comparison with the state-of-the-art Valgrind Memcheck tool reveals that Dr. Memory is twice as fast as Memcheck on average and up to four times faster on individual benchmarks.}

Recent work has proposed network-level techniques to automate worm containment; these techniques have limitations because there is no information about the vulnerabilities exploited by worms at the network level. We propose Vigilante, a new end-to-end approach to contain worms automatically that addresses these limitations. Vigilante relies on collaborative worm detection at end hosts, but does not require hosts to trust each other. Hosts run instrumented software to detect worms and broadcast self-certifying alerts (SCAs) upon worm detection. SCAs are proofs of vulnerability that can be inexpensively verified by any vulnerable host. When hosts receive an SCA, they generate filters that block infection by analysing the SCA-guided execution of the vulnerable software. We show that Vigilante can automatically contain fast-spreading worms that exploit unknown vulnerabilities without blocking innocuous traffic.}

abstract = {Software vulnerabilities have had a devastating effect on the Internet. Worms such as CodeRed and Slammer can compromise hundreds of thousands of hosts within hours or even minutes, and cause millions of dollars of damage [26, 43]. To successfully combat these fast automatic Internet attacks, we need fast automatic attack detection and filtering mechanisms.
In this paper we propose dynamic taint analysis for automatic detection of overwrite attacks, which include most types of exploits. This approach does not need source code or special compilation for the monitored program, and hence works on commodity software. To demonstrate this idea, we have implemented TaintCheck, a mechanism that can perform dynamic taint analysis by performing binary rewriting at run time. We show that TaintCheck reliably detects most types of exploits. We found that TaintCheck produced no false positives for any of the many different programs that we tested. Further, we describe how TaintCheck could improve automatic signature generation in several ways.}

This paper demonstrates the use of a well-known technique, data tainting, to track data received from the network as it propagates through a system and to prevent its execution. Unlike past approaches to taint tracking, which track tainted data by running the system completely in an emulator or simulator, resulting in considerable execution overhead, our work demonstrates the ability to dynamically switch a running system between virtualized and emulated execution. Using this technique, we are able to explore hardware support for taint-based protection that is deployable in real-world situations, as emulation is only used when tainted data is being processed by the CPU. By modifying the CPU, memory, and I/O devices to support taint tracking and protection, we guarantee that data received from the network may not be executed, even if it is written to, and later read from disk. We demonstrate near native speeds for workloads where little taint data is present.}

Prior work shows that information flow tracking (also referred to as taint analysis) is a promising technique to detect a wide range of security attacks. However, current information flow tracking systems are not very practical, because they either require program annotations, source code, non-trivial hardware extensions, or incur prohibitive runtime overheads. This paper proposes a low overhead, software-only information flow tracking system, called LIFT, which minimizes run-time overhead by exploiting dynamic binary instrumentation and optimizations for detecting various types of security attacks without requiring any hardware changes. More specifically, LIFT aggressively eliminates unnecessary dynamic information flow tracking, coalesces information checks, and efficiently switches between target programs and instrumented information flow tracking code. We have implemented LIFT on a dynamic binary instrumentation framework on Windows. Our real-system experiments with two real-world server applications, one client application and eighteen attack benchmarks show that LIFT can effectively detect various types of security attacks. LIFT also incurs very low overhead, only 6.2\% for server applications, and 3.6 times on average for seven SPEC INT2000 applications. Our dynamic optimizations are very effective in reducing the overhead by a factor of 5-12 times.}

For instance, previous software based techniques for taint-tracking on binary code have typically slowed down programs by a factor of 3 or more. In contrast, source-code based techniques have achieved better performance using high level optimizations. Unfortunately, these optimizations are difficult to perform on binaries since much of the high level program structure required by such static analyses is lost during the compilation process. In this paper, we address this challenge by developing static techniques that can recover some of the higher level structure from x86 binaries. Our new static analysis enables effective optimizations, which are applied in the context of taint tracking. As a result, we achieve a substantial reduction in performance overheads as compared to previous works.}

Even software from reputable vendors, such as Google Desktop and Sony DRM media player, may perform undesirable actions. Unfortunately, existing techniques for detecting malware and analyzing unknown code samples are insufficient and have significant shortcomings. We observe that malicious information access and processing behavior is the fundamental trait of numerous malware categories breaching users' privacy (including keyloggers, password thieves, network sniffers, stealth backdoors, spyware and rootkits), which separates these malicious applications from benign software. We propose a system, Panorama, to detect and analyze malware by capturing this fundamental trait. In our extensive experiments, Panorama successfully detected all the malware samples and had very few false positives. Furthermore, by using Google Desktop as a case study, we show that our system can accurately capture its information access and processing behavior, and we can confirm that it does send back sensitive information to remote servers in certain settings. We believe that a system such as Panorama will offer indispensable assistance to code analysts and malware researchers by enabling them to quickly comprehend the behavior and innerworkings of an unknown sample.}

We evaluate performance of a user-mode system using both SPEC2000 and some challenging Windows applications. StarDBT runs the SPEC2000 benchmark competitively to other state-of-the-art binary translators. For Windows applications that are typically multi-threaded GUI-based interactive applications with large code footprint, the StarDBT system provides acceptable performance in many cases. However, there are important scenarios in which dynamic translation still incurs significant runtime overhead, raising issues for further research. The major overheads are caused by the translation overhead of large volume of infrequently-executed code and by the emulation overhead for indirect branches.},

Widely-used techniques such as memory checking suffer from overheads that limit their use to pre-deployment testing, while more advanced systems have such severe performance impacts that they may require special-purpose hardware. Previous works have described hardware that can accelerate individual analyses, but such specialization stymies adoption; generalized mechanisms are more likely to be added to commercial processors. This paper demonstrates that the ability to set an unlimited number of fine-grain data watchpoints can reduce the runtime overheads of numerous dynamic software analysis techniques. We detail the watchpoint capabilities required to accelerate these analyses while remaining general enough to be useful in the future. We describe a hardware design that stores watchpoints in main memory and utilizes two different on-chip caches to accelerate performance. The first is a bitmap lookaside buffer that stores fine-grained watchpoints, while the second is a range cache that can efficiently hold large contiguous regions of watchpoints. As an example of the power of such a system, it is possible to use watchpoints to accelerate read/write set checks in a software data race detector by nearly 9x.}

 abstract = {Shadow value tools use metadata to track properties of application data at the granularity of individual machine instructions. These tools provide effective means of monitoring and analyzing the runtime behavior of applications. However, the high runtime overhead stemming from fine-grained monitoring often limits the use of such tools. Furthermore, 64-bit architectures pose a new challenge to the building of efficient memory shadowing tools. Current tools are not able to efficiently monitor the full 64-bit address space due to limitations in their shadow metadata translation.

This paper presents an efficient and scalable memory shadowing framework called Umbra. Employing a novel translation scheme, Umbra supports efficient mapping from application data to shadow metadata for both 32-bit and 64-bit applications. Umbra's translation scheme does not rely on any platform features and is not restricted to any specific shadow memory size. We also present several mapping optimizations and general dynamic instrumentation techniques that substantially reduce runtime overhead, and demonstrate their effectiveness on a real-world shadow value tool. We show that shadow memory translation overhead can be reduced to just 133\% on average.}

 abstract = {Several existing dynamic binary analysis tools use shadowmemory-they shadow, in software, every byte of memory used by a program with another value that says something about it. Shadow memory is difficult to implement both efficiently and robustly. Nonetheless, existing shadow memory implementations have not been studied in detail. This is unfortunate, because shadow memory is powerful-for example, some of the existing tools that use it detect critical errors such as bad memory accesses, data races, and uses of uninitialised or untrusted data. In this paper we describe the implementation of shadow memory in Memcheck, a popular memory checker built with Valgrind, a dynamic binary instrumentation framework. This implementation has several novel features that make it efficient: carefully chosen data structures and operations result in a mean slow-down factor of only 22.2 and moderate memory usage. This may sound slow, but we show it is 8.9 times faster and 8.5 times smaller on average than a naive implementation, and shadow memory operations account for only about half of Memcheck's execution time. Equally importantly, unlike some tools, Memcheck's shadow memory implementation is robust: it is used on Linux by thousands of programmers on sizeable programs such as Mozilla and OpenOffice, and is suited to almost any memory configuration. This is the first detailed description of a robust shadow memory implementation, and the first detailed experimental evaluation of any shadow memory implementation. The ideas within are applicable to any shadow memory tool built with any instrumentation framework.}

It is shown to outperform all other known community detection methods in terms of computation time. Moreover, the quality of the communities detected is very good, as measured by the so-called modularity. This is shown first by identifying language communities in a Belgian mobile phone network of 2 million customers and by analysing a web graph of 118 million nodes and more than one billion links. The accuracy of our algorithm is also verified on ad hoc modular networks.}

 abstract ={We present a simple architectural mechanism called dynamic information flow tracking that can significantly improve the security of computing systems with negligible performance overhead. Dynamic information flow tracking protects programs against malicious software attacks by identifying spurious information flows from untrusted I/O and restricting the usage of the spurious information.Every security attack to take control of a program needs to transfer the program's control to malevolent code. In our approach, the operating system identifies a set of input channels as spurious, and the processor tracks all information flows from those inputs. A broad range of attacks are effectively defeated by checking the use of the spurious values as instructions and pointers.Our protection is transparent to users or application programmers; the executables can be used without any modification. Also, our scheme only incurs, on average, a memory overhead of 1.4\% and a performance overhead of 1.1\%.}

As such, compilation speed is more important in a Java JIT compiler than in a traditional compiler, requiring optimization algorithms to be lightweight and effective. We present the structure of a Java JIT compiler for the Intel Architecture, describe the lightweight implementation of JIT compiler optimizations (e.g., common subexpression elimination, register allocation, and elimination of array bounds checking), and evaluate the performance benefits and tradeoffs of the optimizations. This JIT compiler has been shipped with version 2.5 of Intel's VTune for Java product.}

 abstract = {The linear scan algorithm for register allocation provides a good register assignment with a low compilation overhead and is thus frequently used for just-in-time compilers. Although most of these compilers use static single assignment (SSA) form, the algorithm has not yet been applied on SSA form, i.e., SSA form is usually deconstructed before register allocation. However, the structural properties of SSA form can be used to simplify the algorithm.

With only one definition per variable, lifetime intervals (the main data structure) can be constructed without data flow analysis. During allocation, some tests of interval intersection can be skipped because SSA form guarantees non-intersection. Finally, deconstruction of SSA form after register allocation can be integrated into the resolution phase of the register allocator without much additional code.

We modified the linear scan register allocator of the Java HotSpot client compiler so that it operates on SSA form. The evaluation shows that our simpler and faster version generates equally good or slightly better machine code.}
